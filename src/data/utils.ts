    "I'm not sure what answer you were aiming for, but it wasn't that.",
    'My disappointment is palpable. Can you feel it?',
    'Wow. Just... wow.',
    'That answer is a testament to the human capacity for error.',
    'Congratulations on being uniquely incorrect.',
    "I'm starting to think you're doing this on purpose.",

    "The answer is right there! Oh wait, no it isn't, because you picked that.",

    "You're really phoning it in, aren't you?",
    'That answer is a tragedy in three words (or however many you used).',
    "I've heard better answers from a broken record.",
    "You're not even in the right ballpark. You're in a completely different sport.",
    'That answer is as clear as mud.',
    "I'm starting to suspect you're allergic to correct answers.",
    "That's... certainly memorable. For all the wrong reasons.",
    "I'm not sure what your thought process was there, but I'm guessing it involved chaos.",
    "The answer is so simple, it's almost embarrassing that you got it wrong.",

    "Yes. You're technically correct. Which, as we all know, is the least interesting kind of correct.",

    "Excellent. You've proven that even you can get one right eventually.",
    'Correct. Try not to look so smug; it might have been a fluke.',
    "Another one right. Are you sure you haven't been replaced by a more knowledgeable doppelganger?",
    "Yep, you nailed it. Let's move on before you break the streak.",
    "Correct. Don't get any big ideas about winning.",
    "That's the answer we were looking for. Eventually. After all the wrong ones.",

    "Correct. Try to contain your excitement; it's just a quiz.",
    "Well done. You've managed to avoid utter failure on this one.",
    'That is correct. Perhaps you should retire now, at your peak.',
    "Yes, you're right. Don't expect a medal or anything.",
    "Correct. Let's hope you remember it for the next time this question comes up in a thousand years.",
    "You actually got that? Maybe there's hope for you yet. Nah, probably not.",
    "That's correct. Try to act like this is normal for you.",
    'Yes, the answer is correct. What a truly unremarkable event.',
    "Correct. You're on a winning streak of one. Cherish it.",
    "That's right. Don't let this momentary success fool you.",
    "You've done it. You've answered correctly. The universe remains unchanged.",
    'Correct. Now, brace yourself for questions that might actually challenge you.',
